    <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1" style="font-size: ;"> 10 Ways to Manage Stress Naturally. <span class="text-body-secondary">Be Stress Free</span></h2> 
            <p class="lead">1. Exercise Regularly
Physical activity boosts endorphins (feel-good hormones), improves mood, and reduces anxiety. Even a 30-minute walk, yoga, or stretching can help. <br> <br>
2. Practice Deep Breathing
Deep, slow breaths activate the parasympathetic nervous system, calming the body and reducing cortisol levels. Try 4-7-8 breathing or box breathing.<br> <br>

3. Meditation and Mindfulness
Mindfulness helps you stay present and reduces overthinking. Guided meditations or simple awareness of your breath for 10 minutes daily can bring relief.
<br> <br>
4. Maintain a Healthy Diet
Nutrient-rich foods stabilize energy and mood. Avoid excessive caffeine, sugar, and processed foods. Include omega-3s, leafy greens, and whole grains. <br> <br>

5. Get Quality Sleep
Lack of sleep worsens stress. Aim for 7â€“9 hours of restful sleep. Create a calming bedtime routine and limit screen time before bed. <br><br>

6. Connect with Nature
Spending time in green spaces reduces stress hormones and improves well-being. Even 15 minutes in a park or balcony garden helps.<br><br>

7. Limit Screen and Social Media Time
Too much screen time, especially doom-scrolling, can increase anxiety. Set boundaries and take digital breaks.<br><br>

8. Stay Connected with Loved Ones
Talking to friends or family provides emotional support and helps release stress. Social interaction can lift your mood naturally.<br><br>

9. Keep a Journal
Writing down thoughts helps release mental clutter and process emotions. Gratitude journaling is especially effective in shifting focus.<br><br>

10. Engage in Creative Activities
Painting, music, dance, or any hobby diverts attention from stress and promotes relaxation through self-expression.<br><br>
