                <p class="lead">✅ 1. Maintain a Balanced Routine
Set a daily schedule including study, meals, sleep, and relaxation.

Avoid overloading yourself—plan short, focused study sessions. <br><br>

✅ 2. Prioritize Sleep
Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep.

Lack of sleep can cause irritability, anxiety, and poor focus.<br><br>

✅ 3. Eat a Nutritious Diet
Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein-rich foods.

Stay hydrated—avoid excessive junk food and caffeine.<br><br>

✅ 4. Exercise Regularly
Physical activity boosts mood and reduces stress hormones.

Even 20–30 minutes of walking, yoga, or cycling helps.<br><br>

✅ 5. Take Breaks During Study
Follow the Pomodoro Technique (25 mins study, 5 mins break).

Breaks refresh the mind and prevent burnout.<br><br>
✅ 6. Talk About Your Feelings
Share with friends, family, or a counselor.

Bottling up emotions increases anxiety.<br><br>

✅ 7. Limit Social Media Use
Excessive scrolling can lead to comparison and anxiety.

Use apps mindfully and take digital detoxes when needed.<br><br>

✅ 8. Practice Mindfulness or Meditation
Helps with focus, calmness, and emotional control.

Just 10 minutes a day can make a big difference.<br><br>

✅ 9. Set Realistic Goals
Break large tasks into small, achievable steps.

Celebrate small wins to stay motivated.<br><br>

✅ 10. Seek Help When Needed
Don't hesitate to approach a school counselor or mental health professional.

Asking for help is a strength, not a weakness.<br><br>
